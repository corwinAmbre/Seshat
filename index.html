<h2>
<a id="what-is-it-about" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it-about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it about?</h2>

<p>Seshat project aims to provide a tool to help you planning, organizing and writing your own book, novel, scenario...  The idea came during my first <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>. At this point I was using <a href="http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter6.html">yWriter 6</a> which is very useful but was not totally suited for my needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was writing on several PC and I had to have a version of the tool on each of it</li>
<li>The User Experience was poor (again, it's only my feeling as a beginner, it helped me a lot anyway)</li>
<li>It was not possible to work / review on my smartphone the project</li>
<li>Back-up was made locally and without the possibility to track changes in the text (or I didn't find it)
My answer was to setup a git repository on my personal server to track changes on RTF files that actually contained the content and to store the binary object to be able to launch the application on all of my machines.
As I'm a little bit geeky, I decided to launch this project to build a tool that would fit my needs and if it can help other writers that a real bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-will-it-be-implemented" class="anchor" href="#how-will-it-be-implemented" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will it be implemented?</h2>

<p>For now I really don't know yet. As I'm working on the fundations of the project, I have to find a balance between security (in order to ensure that the book cannot be stolen form the author) and functionnality (if the storage is fully encrypted, how can I track changes?).
I'm pretty sure it will be implemented as a web tool, most probably with an offline mode. It could be associated to an application but in this case it would complexify the usage of the tool for non-technical users.</p>
