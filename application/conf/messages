On the other side, it also implies that if you loose your password, you'll loose all of your data.<br/>As another consequence, <span class="lobster">Seshat</span> will also requests you to confirm your password for few specific actions like creating a new novel or synchronizing data accross several openned sessions.<br/>A back-up mechanism will be created to allow you to save externally your data in clear text.
