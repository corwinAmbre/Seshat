			<h2>What is <span class="lobster">Seshat</span>?</h2>
			<div class="separator"></div>
			<p><span class="lobster">Seshat</span> is a web tool to help you planning, organizing and writing your own book, novel, scenario...</p>
			<p>
				The idea came during my first <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>. At this point I was using <a href="http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter6.html">yWriter 6</a> which is very useful but was not totally suited for my needs so I decided to create my own tool and to share it with anyone who could be interested as well.

							You're the only one able to read your novel and work on it until you decide to unveal it. Data are cyphered directly in your browser before being sent to <span class="lobster">Seshat</span> and decyphered locally as well which means that <span class="lobster">Seshat</span> has no way to decypher data that belongs to you. On the other side, it also implies that if you loose your password, you'll loose all of your data.<br/>
							As another consequence, <span class="lobster">Seshat</span> will also requests you to confirm your password for few specific actions like creating a new novel or synchronizing data accross several openned sessions.<br/>
							A back-up mechanism will be created to allow you to save externally your data in clear text.
